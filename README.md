# Feature-Engineering-Project
In this project, we delve into the art and science of feature engineering, employing two diverse datasets to showcase a variety of techniques for handling and imputing missing data. The datasets utilized are the classic titanic.csv and a contemporary housing society data set.

# Feature Engineering on Titanic Dataset  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **Feature Engineering** techniques applied to the Titanic dataset. The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful features that improve machine learning model performance.  

We handle missing values, create new features, and preprocess both numerical and categorical data for better predictive accuracy.

## 📝 Description of Feature Engineering Techniques  

### 1️⃣ **Handling Missing Values**  
**Numerical Data:**  
- **Mean / Median Imputation** → Replaces missing values with the average or median of the feature.  
- **End of Distribution Imputation** → Replaces missing values with an extreme value (3 standard deviations above the mean).  
- **Random Sample Imputation** → Selects a random existing value to replace missing data.  
- **Indicator Variables for Missing Values** → Creates a new binary column (`1` for missing, `0` for present).  

### 2️⃣ **Handling Missing Categorical Data**  
- **Mode Imputation** → Fills missing values with the most frequently occurring category.  
- **Capturing Missing Categorical Data** → Instead of direct imputation, we add a new feature indicating whether a value was missing.  
- **Encoding Categorical Features** → One-hot encoding & label encoding techniques are used to convert categorical variables into numerical format.  

### 3️⃣ **Feature Engineering Techniques**  
- **Binning Continuous Features** → Converts continuous data into discrete bins (e.g., Age groups).  
- **Creating New Features** → Example: A binary indicator for missing cabin values (`Cabin_null`).  
- **Handling Outliers** → Detecting and treating extreme values to improve model robustness.
